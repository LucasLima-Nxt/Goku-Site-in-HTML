# Goku-Site-in-HTML
I challenged myself to create an entire website in HTML. I recently started my studies in the area, and I decided to pay homage to Akira Toriyama with his manga Dragon Ball, with the character Goku and his transformations. I intend to make more changes to the website using CSS, JavaScript and databases. I made this page to test my HTML skills.
